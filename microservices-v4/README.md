# Learn Microservices with Spring Boot - v4

This project contains the version 4 of the application that is developed under the scope of the book *Learn Microservices with Spring Boot*. You can get a copy of the book on [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2FSB2ME) or [Apress](http://www.apress.com/book/9781484231647).

The book shows you how to evolve a simple Spring Boot application to become a full Microservices Architecture, using Spring Cloud Eureka, Ribbon, Zuul and Hystrix to implement Service Discovery, Load Balancing, the API Gateway pattern and a Circuit Breaker. Besides, you'll learn how to implement End-to-End tests with Cucumber, an Event-Driven system and the best practices when building Microservices.
